            <p>
              Born to George and Marimma in 1968 in a calm and beautiful high range village called Mariyapuram in idukki district, Kerala, as referred as God’s own country, not sure if its people are the same. 
              I can remember the event ful childhood, full of adventures activities and leading a tomb boy life. I could climb any trees in farm and reach for the last mango hidden at the top branch. Climbing the jackfruit trees with bambo ladder and dad coming to get me down .
              Amazing school days, children from 9-10 families of different ages forming a group and running to school eith all the laughter and chatter. We lived close to nature farming was the only souce of income. Children did there part to by helping in the feild, drawing water from the well and fectching water from far away places in summer days. 
              I had to do the shop run too to a far off tiny city to buy thingd from the age of 7.I had to walk for almost 2 hours own my own, then I could imagine things that I want to happen . 
              I got into reading from paper wrapping , which used in grocery shop to pack food items initially and started reading all sort child publications of the time and magazines and weeklies which was for elders. 
              School days were fun was poverty striken too. We had to live on the bare minimum as Dad had taken in to alcoholism. 
              Mum was very strict and kept on motivating us to study and a get a job. I was an average student passed college with okay grades. 
              Went to North India Bombay, did nursing
